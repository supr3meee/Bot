# Bot
This is my first experience.
The code works, but it runs sequentially despite the asynchronous functions, which is my number one problem.
I perfectly understand that the code is terrible, but everyone started somewhere.
The essence of the bot is that it shows the most similar cars in a given location, in response to the one that is sent to the bot.
